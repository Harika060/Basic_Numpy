## Pandas Overview

Pandas is a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis, built on top of NumPy. It provides data structures and functions needed to work with structured data seamlessly. Here are some key highlights:

- **DataFrame**: A 2D labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table.
- **Series**: A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type.
- **Data Loading**: Easily read data from CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL databases, and more into DataFrames.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing data, remove duplicates, and perform data transformations.
- **Data Selection**: Filter and select data using labels, conditions, or indices.
- **Grouping and Aggregation**: Perform split-apply-combine operations, group by categories, and compute aggregations.
- **Time Series**: Provides robust support for time-series data, including date parsing, resampling, and rolling statistics.
- **Integration with Other Libraries**: Works seamlessly with NumPy for numerical operations and Matplotlib for data visualization.

### Installation

To install Pandas using pip, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas
